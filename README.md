# Single_LED_Blink
This project demonstrates a basic LED blinking application using the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller programmed in Embedded C using Keil µVision IDE. The LED is connected to pin P0.17 and configured as an active-high output through GPIO registers. The program continuously toggles the LED with a software delay to create a blinking effect. A Proteus simulation is included to verify the functionality without physical hardware.
